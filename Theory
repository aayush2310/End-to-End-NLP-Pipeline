Converting text to numbers is called feature Engineering.-Text vectorization
The type of feature engineering depends upon the type of problem we are solving.

When we make a ML pipeline then the feature engineering stage is a bit different than that of the DL based pipeline.
In Ml model we need to the feature engineering step,in Dl model we dont need to do it ourselves.The adv of Ml based pipeline feature engineering is that since we do the
feature engineering,so we can justify the result.Interpretibility is retained.The disadvantage is that we need domain knowledge to do this task-hectic.
Second problem is that sometimes there are features which damage our model .
